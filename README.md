## 2.2 Aim, Shoot & Line Renderer

In this step I implemented an aiming and shooting system similar to Peggle.

- The cannon rotates towards the mouse using an Aim script.
- Holding the left mouse button builds up force.
- A Line Renderer visualizes the shot power.
- Releasing the mouse button shoots the ball using AddForce.
- The ball interacts with physics and collides with targets.
